<p>When clients approach us with an idea which requires huge investments and the client is not sure of the acceptable level from the end user and seems confused we often suggest him / her to move ahead with proof of concept which requires less time and budget to built and by launching it our clients get an idea of what users think and also gathers feedback. If things go well then we incorporate the feedback and upgrade the proof of concept to a full application.</p>

<h3>Some benefits of POC</h3>
<ul>
<li>Low budget and quicker time to market</li>
<li>Generate valuable feedback from end users</li>
<li>The concept is already sold through the POC</li>
<li>Chances of getting investments from people who liked the idea</li>
<li>It gives you complete scope of work along with wireframe architecture</li>
