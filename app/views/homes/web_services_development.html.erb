We services are most important part of any application now a days and we specialize in web services and API development services (REST). REST defines a set of architectural principles by which you can design Web services that focus on a system's resources, including how resource states are addressed and transferred over HTTP by a wide range of clients written in different languages. When designing a REST API or service we follow established best practices for dealing with security (Authentication, Authorization, Identity Management) Some benefits of API / Web services</p>
<h3>Exposing the function on to network</h3>

<p>A Web service is a unit of managed code that can be remotely invoked using HTTP, that is, it can be activated using HTTP requests</p>
<h3>Connecting Different Applications</h3>

<p>Web Services allows different applications to talk to each other and share data and services among themselves</p>
<h3>Standardized Protocol</h3>
<p>
Standardized Protocol: Web Services uses standardized industry standard protocol for the communication. All the four layers (Service Transport, XML Messaging, Service Description and Service Discovery layers) uses the well defined protocol in the Web Services protocol stack. This standardization of protocol stack gives the business many advantages like wide range of choices, reduction in the cost due to competition and increase in the quality.</p>

<h3>Low Cost of communication</h3>

<p>Web Services uses SOAP over HTTP protocol for the communication, so you can use your existing low cost internet for implementing Web Services. This solution is much less costly compared to proprietary solutions like EDI/B2B.</p>
<h3>Support for Other communication means</h3>

<p>Beside SOAP over HTTP, Web Services can also be implemented on other reliable transport mechanisms. So, it gives flexibility use the communication means of your requirement and choice.</p>
<h3>Loosely Coupled Applications</h3>

<p>Web Services are self-describing software modules which encapsulates discrete functionality. Web Services are accessible via standard Internet communication protocols like XML and SOAP.</p>
<h3>Web Services Sharing</h3>

<p>These days due to complexness of the business, organizations are using different technologies like EAI, EDI, B2B, Portals etc. for distributing computing. Web Services supports all these technologies, thus helping the business to use existing investments in other technologies.</p>
<h3>Web Services are Self Describing</h3>

<p>Web Services are self describing applications, which reduces the software development time.</p>
<h3>Automatic Discovery</h3>

<p>Web Services automatic discovery mechanism helps the business to easy find the Service Providers. This also helps your customer to find your services easily.</p>
<h3>Business Opportunity</h3>

<p>Web Services has opened the door to new business opportunities by making it easy to connect with partners.</p>
